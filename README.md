# Shop-Galore-Ecommerce-Site
 This is my ever serious web app. I used HTML, CSS, Tailwind and Vanilla Javascript. In this project I aimed to establish a unique Ecommerce Store that will be able to shift products worldwide in a very limited amount of time. This is good for busy customers. I will continue to improve this and then deploy it to netlify soon.
